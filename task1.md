# Task 1

- 1.1 Find out if there is any difference of two tree structures from two dataset `structure_tree_safe_2017.csv` & `structures.json`

  - There have different tree in both JSON and CSV files.
  - So, to create a function which input will be either JSON or CSV to determine whether two data type is the same.
  - return TRUE if it is the same / return False if it is not the same.

    - example in R:
    ```r 
    a <- list(c(1,2,3))
    b <- list(c(1,2,3))
    identical(a,b) 

- 1.2 How to provide better visualization of this tree structure, plot using any tool
