# Task 1

- 1.1 find out if there is any difference of two tree strcutures from two dataset `structure_tree_safe_2017.csv` & `structures.json`

there have different tree in both JSON and CSV files.
So, to create a function which input will be either JSON or CSV to determine whether two data type is the same.
return TRUE if it is the same.
return False if it is not the same.

example in R:
a<-list(c(1,2,3))
a
b <- list(c(1,2,3))
identical(a,b) 

- 1.2 how to provide better visualization of this tree structure, plot using any tool
